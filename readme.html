<h4><b> Purpose </b></h4>
<p>This simulation tool is designed to give a rough estimate of risk for hosting summer camp or other similar sleep-away events. Understanding the simulation assumptions is key to interpreting the results. Please read this first to understand how to change your simulation assumptions.</p>

<h4> <b>Simulation Inputs and Assumptions </b></h4>
<p>These simulations do not take into account the possibility that individuals could have a low viral burden and thus be difficult to detect but still be infectious. This is a major limitation of this analysis and undetectable transmission should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>These simulations assume a certain number of individuals are infected, and does not consider the possibility that 0 individuals are initially infected. For example, if the community positivity rate is 3%, in a 100 person camp there is a 4.7% chance no one is infected. Equation: % chance no one is infected = 100*(1 - community positivity rate)^camp_size</p>
<p>The vaccine is assumed to have 95% efficacy as reported recently by Pfizer and Moderna.</p>
<p>400 simulations are performed for each initial infected individuals scenario. Simulating 10 scenarios takes approximately 6-10 minutes, depending on the camp and cabin size. If you choose a large range of initial infections with a small step, the simulation will take a long time.  </p>

<h5><b>Camp Schedule & Logistics </b> </h5>
<p>Testing is performed during check-in prior to arriving to camp. Positive individuals will not be allowed to attend and will be sent home with parents or not allowed to board the camp bus. Testing is performed every morning on all individuals prior to any activities. Individuals that test positive will be placed in quarantine and will no longer infect anyone else.</p>

<h5><b>COVID Test </b> </h5>
<p>The default COVID test used in these simulations is based off the first FDA approved fully take-at-home test developed by Lucira Health. Each testing unit is independent and tests will take approximately 30 minutes and can be run completely in parallel. The reported sensitivity and specificity is 94% and 98% respectively. Each unit is expected to cost $50. As additional at home tests are approved, you can adjust the sensitivity and specificity in the simulation. </p>

<h5><b>Infection Risk during Day & Night Activities </b> </h5>
<p>Infection rate during day or night activities is estimated as a cumulative infection risk per active infection. Day activities assume that all campers and staff are mixing and thus all have an equal chance for infection. Night activities assume that campers and staff are living in separate cabins (you can designate cabin size). For example, if there are 2 active undetected infections then each each person has a 10% chance of being infected during the day (default day infection rate per active infection = 5%). You can adjust this risk up or down based on whether you will require masks, have staggered meals, or other infection preventative measures. Night infection risk is limited to ONlY those living in the same cabin. The default infection rate per active infection is 50% assuming a small cabin and sleeping without masks.
