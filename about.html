<h4> Vincent Chang </h4>
<p> I am a PhD student at the University of California San Francisco studying computational pharmacology. I grew up in summer camps all across the United States, but every summer I made sure to never miss LYF Camp. My love for summer camps and my particular skillset have spurred me to develop this simulation tool so we can assess the risk and safety of hosting summer camp during the COVID pandemic. I hope this will be useful for other summer camps as well. You can email me if you have any questions about the simulation tool or how to interpret results.</p>

<h4> LYF Camp </h4>
<p>LYF Camp is a 6 day 5 night Taiwanese American youth leadership summer camp based in the San Francisco Bay Area. We are a non-profit community organization led by second generation Taiwanese Americans, who build a camp community to foster growth, exploration, and discovery. Through LYF Camp, we provide a safe environment for youth to discover and develop who they are, and to work towards their full potential. All of our activities are designed to fulfill one or more of the following goals:
<ul>
    <li>Cultivate their leadership and communication skills.</li>
    <li>Deepen the campers’ understanding of their unique cultural heritage.</li>
    <li>Nurture the campers’ interests and passions.</li>
    <li>Connect them with other Taiwanese Americans.</li>
</ul></p>
